<h1>The Best Movies According to Kyle</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>This is my Tarantino Film. Everytime I watch it I notice something different I felt as though I have never seen before.</p>
<h3>Moonrise Kingdom</h3>
<p>A feel good quirky film by Wes Anderson. It reminds me of how simple life can be.</p>
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>One of top animated films. Everything by Hayao Miyazaki is superb and this was my first introduction to him.</p>
